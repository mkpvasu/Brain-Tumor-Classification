### Description

Brain tumors are one of the most serious illnesses which accounts for 85% to 90% of all primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors. During 2020 alone, it has affected nearly 300,000+ people worldwide according to statistics published by Cancer.net. It is also the 10th leading cause of death for men and women. Early detection and accurate understanding of the intricacies in types of the tumor which helps in curing, providing medication and prevention of the disease in future. The radiologists primarily use Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to analyze brain tumors. This provides an information about whether the brain is normal or abnormal and further aids in identifying the type of it. The advancements in machine learning and computer vision can give an valuable assistance to the doctors in swiftly and precisely determining the presence and type of tumor.

This motivated us take up to classify brain tumors through MRIs by training a neural network model through the [Brain Tumor Classification (MRI)](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427?file=7953679) open source dataset as our project. There are three classifications we&#39;ll be working with: Glioma tumor / Meningioma tumor / Pituitary tumor. We&#39;ll be using the neural network introduced in lecture and applying different activation functions to test out their accuracies. We might try fitting in multiple layers to increase the overall accuracy and tuning parameters to prevent overfitting of the model. We&#39;ll mainly focus on training the model through the brain tumor images in the specified dataset.
